%% Dijkstra Algotihm

% The Dijkstra algorithm compute the geodesic distance on a graph. We use here a graph whose nodes are the pixels, and whose edges defines the usual 4-connectity relationship.
% 
% In the following, we use the notation i?j
% to indicate that an index j is a neighbor of i
% 
% on the graph defined by the discrete grid.
% 
% The metric W(x)
% . We use here a constant metric.

W = ones(n);

% Set S={x0} of initial points.

x0 = [n/2;n/2];

% Initialize the stack of available indexes.
I = sub2ind1(x0);

% Initialize the distance to +?, excepted for the boundary conditions.
D = zeros(n)+Inf; 
D(I) = 0;

% Initialize the state to 0 (unexplored), excepted for the boundary point S (indexed by |I|) to 1 (front).
S = zeros(n);
S(I) = 1;

% The first step of each iteration of the method is to pop the from stack the element i
% with smallest current distance Di.

[tmp,j] = sort(D(I)); j = j(1);
i = I(j); I(j) = [];

% We update its state S
% to be dead (-1).

S(i) = -1;

% Retrieve the list of the four neighbors.
J = [Neigh(i,1); Neigh(i,2); Neigh(i,3); Neigh(i,4)];

% Remove those that are dead (no need to consider them anymore).
J(S(J)==-1) = [];

% Add those that are not yet considered (state 0) to the front stack I (state 1).

%% Fast Marching
% The Dijstra algorithm suffers from a strong metrization problem, and it actually computes the ?1
% distance on the grid.
% The Fast Marching algorithm replace the graph update by a local resolution of the Eikonal equation. This reduces significantly the grid bias, and can be shown to converge to the underlying geodesic distance when the grid step size tends to zero.
% Over a continuous domain, the distance map D(x)
% to a set of seed points S is the unique solution in the viscosity sense
% ?x?S,??D(x)?=W(x)and?y?S,D(y)=0.
% The equation is then discretized on a grid of n×n
% pixel, and a solution (Dk,?)nk,?=1?Rn×n is found by using an upwind finite difference approximation, that is faithful to the viscosity solution
% ?(k,?)?S~,?(?D)k,??=Wk,?$and?(k,?)?S~,Dk,?=0,
% where S~ is the set of discrete starting points (defined here by |x0|).
% To be consisten with the viscosity solution, one needs to use a non-linear upwind gradient derivative. This corresponds to computing the norm of the gradient as
% ?(?D)k,??2=max(Dk+1,??Dk,?,Dk?1,??Dk,?,0)2+max(Dk,?+1?Dk,?,Dk,??1?Dk,?,0)2.
% A each step of the FM propagation, one update Dk,??d
% by solving the eikonal equation with respect to Dk,? alone. This is equivalent to solving the quadratic equation
% (d?dx)2+(d?dy)2=w2wherew=Wk,?.
% and where dx=min(Dk+1,?,Dk?1,?)anddy=min(Dk,?+1,Dk,??1).
% The update is thus defined as
% d={dx+dy+??2when??0,min(dx,dy)+wotherwise.$$where?=2w2?(dx?dy)2.
% Note that in the case where ?<0
% , one has to use the Dijkstra update.
% Once the Dijstra algorithm is implemented, the implementation of the Fast Marching is trivial. It just corresponds to replacing the graph udpate

D(j) = min(dx+W(j), dy+W(j));

% by the eikonal update.

Delta = 2*W(j) - (dx-dy)^2;
if Delta>=0
    D(j) = (dx+dy+sqrt(Delta))/2;
else
    D(j) = min(dx+W(j), dy+W(j));

% Once the geodesic distance map to S has been computed, the geodesic curve between any point x1 and S extracted through gradient descent
% ??(t)=??t?D(?(t))and?(0)=x1 where ?t>0

% To obtain unit speed parameterization, one can use ?t=??D(?(t))??1

% The geodesic is then numerically computed using a discretized gradient descent, which defines a discret curve (?k)k using
